# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: 6th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through the website stuff on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Up to 100 points and refreshed on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery. 

**Thoughts** Good to have a refresher on the website stuff, been a couple of years since I've worked with it so there were bits I'd forgotten but it came back quick. Got to do the Tribute page task - will do on Alan Turing. Migraine kicked in though so had to give up for the day. Need to make some written notes to help what I've learnt stick, and also so I can flick back if needed for a reminder - will do tomorrow.

### Day 1: 5th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started building a portfolio site with HTML and Bootstrap. Set up Git, Visual Studio Code and started on homepage.

**Thoughts** Not done any HTML for a while so having to reference quite a bit. Page is just static html at the moment. Want to develop to support 100 days of code log as well as portfolio of work

### Day 0: 3rd April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reading up on 100 Days of Code project, listed some ideas.

**Thoughts:** Want to commit to project but also worried of running out of steam or not knowing what to do next. Come up with a list of ideas of things I'd like to do, or that fit with other work I'm doing and worth exploring. Thinking 10 projects / 10 days to fill up 100 days?
