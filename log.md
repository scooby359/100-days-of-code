# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: 12th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Uni work - C++ (C11, pointers) and Android A6 project. 

**Thoughts** Spent an hour or so on some class work for Uni playing with C11 unique pointers and functors. Then tried to get back to an Android project I started a couple of months ago and left... Didn't realise how rusty I'd be on it! Also played with the Room database manager instead of raw SQLiteDBHelper, so that took a bit of learning on top of remembering my work. But, spent a good hour with build errors and update installations and blah.. so gave up on and will pick it up tomorrow.

### Day 6: 11th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed some JavaScript training on FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** Firstly, I missed coding yesterday - being at uni all day, gym at night and trying to have some time for me meant it just didn't happen. And was going to do some tonight, but it's not happened either as I've been at Uni and the gym again so it leaves little free time... So, taking stock somewhat, I accept that there are some days it's just not going to be practical to get an hour of coding in. I'm making a point of recognising that now as it's going to happen again, and I specifically don't want to get beat up by it as that's just how it is, as long as I'm making the effort when possible. And I'm cool with that :)

That said, I did have some free time during the day today so spent it on the JavaScript exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Have done JS before, but years ago, so it was good to have a refresher and once I realised how similar it was to the languages I've been using lately, I skipped over to the more complex bits. Completed some of the practial challenges and had a play with arrays and regex.

### Day 5: 9th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Portfolio Site. 

**Thoughts** Finished my portfolio! Looked at a few portfolios online last night and took some ideas to change my contacts and about section. Also found a new Bootstrap theme which I like more, and I've filled out the examples so the cards now open modals with an image and details of the example project. Deployed to Azure, put Google analytics in for some basic tracking, and Azure seems to have put SSL on! (not sure how or why!). Ready to move on, and update as needed. Also need to put some of the games assignments on - would like to link to code, but wary or uploading assignment code due to collusion/plagirism issues - will have to just do this for personal projects.

### Day 4: 8th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Portfolio Site. 

**Thoughts** Worked on my Portfolio site, using the ideas I had yesterday. The cards on the home screen now open a modal when clicked, so I can use this to provide more information on each project without cluttering the page. Also done the contacts section with links and embedded mt Twitter feed. Not keen on how the contacts section looks though. Just sussed out Azure web app deployment and uploaded files - I'm online!!! To do - fill in project information and create template for easy updating; sort contacts section (have a look at others pages for ideas)

### Day 3: 7th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page challenge. 

**Thoughts** Short day - still suffering migrane effects so just did a bit late on. Did the tribute page to Alan turing, used Bootstrap, CSS and HTML elements. Uploaded code to GitHub. Also made some notes in my journal about the jQuery functions / format for reference. Next challenge on CodeCamp is portfolio - fits in to what I started a few days ago so will continue to work on that next, using a simple one page format. Can come back and improve on it later - > use modals to pop up info about individual projects, keeps on one page but allows me to embed more detail and take advantage of more Bootstrap tools?

### Day 2: 6th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through the website stuff on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Up to 100 points and refreshed on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery. 

**Thoughts** Good to have a refresher on the website stuff, been a couple of years since I've worked with it so there were bits I'd forgotten but it came back quick. Got to do the Tribute page task - will do on Alan Turing. Migraine kicked in though so had to give up for the day. Need to make some written notes to help what I've learnt stick, and also so I can flick back if needed for a reminder - will do tomorrow.

### Day 1: 5th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started building a portfolio site with HTML and Bootstrap. Set up Git, Visual Studio Code and started on homepage.

**Thoughts** Not done any HTML for a while so having to reference quite a bit. Page is just static html at the moment. Want to develop to support 100 days of code log as well as portfolio of work

### Day 0: 3rd April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reading up on 100 Days of Code project, listed some ideas.

**Thoughts:** Want to commit to project but also worried of running out of steam or not knowing what to do next. Come up with a list of ideas of things I'd like to do, or that fit with other work I'm doing and worth exploring. Thinking 10 projects / 10 days to fill up 100 days?
