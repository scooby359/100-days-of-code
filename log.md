# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 5th April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started building a portfolio site with HTML and Bootstrap. Set up Git, Visual Studio Code and started on homepage.

**Thoughts** Not done any HTML for a while so having to reference quite a bit. Page is just static html at the moment. Want to develop to support 100 days of code log as well as portfolio of work

### Day 0: 3rd April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reading up on 100 Days of Code project, listed some ideas.

**Thoughts:** Want to commit to project but also worried of running out of steam or not knowing what to do next. Come up with a list of ideas of things I'd like to do, or that fit with other work I'm doing and worth exploring. Thinking 10 projects / 10 days to fill up 100 days?
